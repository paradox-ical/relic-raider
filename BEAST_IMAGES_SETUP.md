# 🖼️ Beast Images Setup Guide

## ✅ **COMPLETED!** 
Your beast images are now live and working! The Jungle Ruins region now displays custom pixel art images during battles.

## 🎯 Jungle Ruins Beasts with Images

Your pixel art images are now active for these beasts:

1. **Twisted Serpent of Aztec** - Green serpent image ✅
2. **Ancient Stalker of Aztec** - Lion-like beast with red mane ✅  
3. **Barbed Construct of Aztec** - Stone statue with spiky headdress ✅
4. **Savage Construct of Aztec** - Armored warrior with dual swords ✅
5. **Colossus of Aztec** - Large armored figure with hammer (Boss) ✅

## 🎮 How It Works
- When a player encounters a Jungle Ruins beast, your custom image appears as the embed thumbnail
- Images display in both the encounter screen and during battle
- If no custom image exists, it falls back to the player's avatar
- Boss battles have special recognition and styling

## 🧪 Testing
To test the system:
1. Restart your bot (if not already done)
2. Use `/explore` in the Jungle Ruins region
3. When you encounter a beast, you should see your custom pixel art image!

## 🔧 Adding More Regions
To add images for other regions, simply add more entries to the `beastImages` object in `lib/beast-images.js`.

## 🎨 Your Pixel Art Style
Your pixel art style is perfect for this game! The images will make the Jungle Ruins battles much more immersive and visually appealing. Players will love seeing these custom images during their encounters.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting
- If images don't appear, check that the URLs are accessible
- Make sure the beast names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Discord has a 10MB limit for image files

Your beast images are now live and ready to enhance the player experience! 🌿⚔️
